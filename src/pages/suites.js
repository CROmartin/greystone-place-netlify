    <h1>Suites at Greystone Place</h1>
    <p>Greystone Place by Limeridge mall is a prestigious, upscale address offering safety, security and quiet enjoyment. Meticulously maintained and ideal for mature adults. Sorry, no dogs allowed.</p>
    <p>This excellent mountain location is within close proximity to churches, hospitals, and shopping. Located in the same block as Limeridge Mall, and just steps to public transit. Also, only a short ride to the GO Train and the Lincoln Alexander Expressway.</p>
    <p>Lush landscaping and natural settings grace the exterior while soft, soothing music emanates throughout the lobby and hallways. Clean, bright, spacious 1 bedroom suites are finished in our “designer” color schemes and have generous closet space. All suites include large balconies - some with panoramic views of the Toronto skyline and the Escarpment. Parking for 1 vehicle is included as is heat and hot water. The resident manager lives on site and the clean, modern laundry facility is well equipped with new Maytag washers and dryers.</p>
